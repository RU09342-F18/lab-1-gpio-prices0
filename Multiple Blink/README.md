# Summary
The task of this part of the lab was to have multiple LEDs blink at different rates other than intervals of twice as fast as the other.  
## General Functionality
There are two ".c" files demonstrating how to have a red and green LED blink. This code has one LED blinking at three times faster than the other, this can be found in the "if" statement, the rest of the code is mimicking how a simple delayed blink would function. The "0x03" turs the second LED on for 3 times in a second.
